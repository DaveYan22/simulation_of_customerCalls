# simulation_of_customerCalls


We developed a SimPy-based simulation to model customer service interactions. The project involves simulating customer calls handled by a set number of employees, with randomized call durations and intervals between arrivals. We containerized the project using Docker to ensure a consistent environment for running the simulation, including setting up dependencies and executing the Python script.
